In the town where I was born
lived a man who sailed to sea
and he told us of his life
in the land of submarines.
So we sailed on to the sun
'til we found a sea of green
and we lived beneath the waves
in our yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
